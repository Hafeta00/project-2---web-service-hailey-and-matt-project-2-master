\f0\fs24 \cf0 Peer Review for Hailey Bodycoat\
\
- I was able to reach their endpoint on the web. I tried all the crud requests using postman and was able to receive a response from all of them. I enjoyed the steps provided on the README.md on their GitHub repository and how there are multiple parameters for some commands. Overall I think there is consistency in their baths and I think their repository is better structured and would easily transition into a front end site.  The code had been well structured as well as well commented, and everything is thoroughly explained throughout their repository. I think this group did a great job and provided me some ideas on how to model my own site and improve it.}
